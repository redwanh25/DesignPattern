Decorator Design Pattern : As per the GOF (Gang of Four) definition, decorator Pattern states that we need to “Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide A flexible alternative to sub classing for extending functionality.”

Adapter Design Pattern : The Adapter design pattern is one of the twenty-three well-known GOF (Gang of Four) design patterns that describe how to solve recurring design problems to design flexible and reusable object-oriented software, that is, objects that are easier to implement, change, test, and reuse.
